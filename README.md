# Wordle Bot [![Code Quality][codacy-image]][codacy]

This repository contains Python code to solve Wordle puzzles by maximizing entropy.

## Requirements

- Install the latest version of [Python 3.X][python-download-url].
- Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To compute the optimal first guess, choose the game with `--game-name`:

```bash
python wordle.py --game-name wordle
```

```bash
python wordle.py --game-name dungleon
```

A pre-computed first guess can be specified with `--first-guess`:

```bash
python wordle.py --game-name wordle --first-guess soare
```

```bash
python wordle.py --game-name dungleon --first-guess ZOCFS
```

NB: the `"ZOCFS"` guess in Dungleon corresponds to 🧟👹💰🐸💀.

Alternatively, run [`wordle-bot.ipynb`][colab-notebook]
[![Open In Colab][colab-badge]][colab-notebook]

## Results

Using 3Blue1Brown's code with `priors=get_true_wordle_prior()`, suggested first guesses for Dungleon are:

- `ZOCFS`🧟👹💰🐸💀 (`purely_maximize_information`)
- `CEBSF` 💰🟡🦇💀🐸 (`optimize_for_uniform_distribution`)
- `ZOCFS`🧟👹💰🐸💀 (`look_two_ahead=False`)
- `ZBCFS` 🧟🦇💰🐸💀 (`look_two_ahead=True`)

My adaptation of GillesVandewiele's code would suggest:

- `VZCFS`👨‍🌾🧟💰🐸💀 (guesses constrained to the set of solutions)
- `ZOCFS`🧟👹💰🐸💀 (unconstrained guesses)

For reference, TylerGlaiel's code would suggest:

- `MGCFS`🧙‍♀️👺💰🐸💀 (guesses constrained to the set of solutions)
- `ZOCFS`🧟👹💰🐸💀 (unconstrained guesses)
